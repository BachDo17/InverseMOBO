This repository refers to the manuscript titled "Proximal-exploration multi-objective Bayesian optimization for inverse identification of cyclic constitutive law of structural steels" submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization.\
It consists of:
  1. Sect4_Test_Problem.zip: Test problem in Section 4.
  2. Sect51_Specimen.zip: Parameter identification problem in Section 5.1 (Requirement: Abaqus Student Edition installed).
  3. Sect52_CantileverInput.zip: Three loading histories used in Section 5.2.\
\
Note: Run MOBO_Run.m in each of .zip files of 1. and 2. for solutions to the corresponding problem.\
These problems were solved using Matlab 2017b with Global Optimization Toolbox.
